# Old Repository for : 42sh

This is our old working repository for our UNIX Shell C dev, based on POSIX standard.

## Disclaimer

If you ended up on this repository not by looking for it, I think you should better look at the official repository for this project with the cleaned project [here](https://github.com/Nrechati/42sh-UNIX-Shell). This repository just remain to keep the git history, access and few debug code or functions for me and my former team.
